# About Package Delivery
Our game aims at educating about positive and negative numbers. 

The courier goes up the floors from the ground floor, which is at 0, to the upper floors and underground floors to deliver packages to customers according to the result of the math problem. The player in the character of the courier must deliver packages. Instead of the address, there is a randomly generated math problem on the package. 

For each correctly solved problem, the player receives a coin, which will use to unlock extra features that enhance the gameplay experience.
